## Information
This is a system created to easier manage multiple shows in a festival. This system is designed for budget fesitvals and shows and is not a complete system for a big advanced festival.

This system is for example perfect to use on an school talent show where you have multiple numbers and presenters in a show.

## Language support
The UI was primarly written in Norwegian but we are planing to redo some of the UI to add support for translations. Our goal is to have a fully translated Norwegian and English version.

## Dark mode support
The system is designet with both a light and dark theme. The system will by default use theme after what is primary in the OS.

## Responsive
The system is designet to be used on both desktops, laptops, tablets and phones.
